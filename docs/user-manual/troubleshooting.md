## Port finding
If you can't see the port you are looking for, try to unplug and plug in the dev board to another port. You can try to reflash the sample program.

## Antivirus
It has been reported that some antivirus like Norton Antivirus can cause problems while downloading OwnPlot. If you have trouble downloading OwnPlot, please **disable or trust the executable file**.

## Empty canvas
By default, no activities are loaded into OwnPlot (this might change in the future). Select any tab like the **send** tab to load the graph and terminal
