If you are using Windows, we recommand the use of git bash https://www.git-scm.com/downloads

1. type: \
    `node --version`
    * If the command prompt tells you node isn't present on your computer, then download and install nodejs thru this website:
        https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    * If the version is inferior than version 14.x.x then you'll need to update nodejs. `nvm` is a great little piece of kit that will make your life a lot easier   https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
2. Clone the repository:
    * If you have a gitlab accound and a ssh key linked to this one, clone with this command instead: \
