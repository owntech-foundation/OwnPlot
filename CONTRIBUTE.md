## Community guidelines

Always be nice to other contributors. Be constructive and understanding when interacting with someone. Read and then follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times.

## Bug Report

Please report bugs within the gitlab repository by creating a new issue. Use the bug issue template and try to be as descriptive as possible.
Always check first if a similar issue already exists or has been closed.

## Suggest Feature

Feel free to make any suggestion that would improve the user experience. To do so, please use the feature issue template in the gitlab repository.

## Contribute to the code base

If you want to get involved further, you can write and modify the existing code base available at the gitlab OwnPlot repository.
Your modifications should always be related to an issue.
You can submit a feature/bug issue if no one answers your problematic.
The code base is clearly not perfectly written so far. Code related improvements are welcomed if they make code easier to understand, more compact, faster to execute. A related issue template is available.

#### Coding Style

Always try to make your code as readable as possible as other people will work on it. Names should be as descriptive as possible.
[Here is a guide](https://javascript.info/code-quality) that we try to follow when writing code, so please try to stick to it too.
Do not worry if you do not achieve to write a perfect piece of code, just try to be clear about what you are trying to code.
Comments are precious friends, but should not be redudant with explicit lines of code. Explicit naming should be your first concern.
Other contributors can help you, do not hesitate to ask for help.

#### Submit your modifications

Please begin with creating a branch, which name should be XXXX_nameOfTheBranch, considering XXXX as the number of the corresponding issue.
Then add and commit changes everytime an improvement has been brought to the code, but always ensure that each commit is atomic (brings a full modification and is functionnal).
Consider reading [this page](https://learn.libre.solar/development/version_control.html#commits) for a clear explanation of good practice in commits.
Finally ask for a pull request that will be examined as soon as possible.
